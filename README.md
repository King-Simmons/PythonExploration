# 🐍 Python Exploration

A personal Python playground for hands-on learning, experimentation, and project-based growth.

This repository serves as a centralized workspace for exploring Python through structured challenges and independent coding. The primary focus is Udemy’s **100 Days of Python** course, with room to expand into additional experiments and projects over time.

The emphasis is on consistency, clean code, and practical problem-solving — learning Python by building, iterating, and refining real implementations.

## 🎯 Goals

- Strengthen Python fundamentals through daily practice  
- Build small projects instead of isolated snippets  
- Develop problem-solving intuition and coding discipline  
- Experiment freely while maintaining organized progress  
- Track learning in a single evolving repository
